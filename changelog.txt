1.4
Changed PM2.5 library from Honeywell to PMS5003 - PM2.5 stop does not turn off the sensor. It only stops it from being polled, which makes other commands more stable by disabling the SoftwareSerial port.
Saved some SRAM by changing PM2.5 and Ultrasonic LSB/MSB variables from global to local, since they are only used for building the firmata message for their respective polling codes
Reduced error string buffer from 50 bytes to 40 bytes to free some SRAM

1.3.2
Increased size of firmata serial buffer from 64 to 74, to improve performance with large commands (>32 bytes) - Better performance for the OLED

1.3.1
Fixed error causing numActiveSonars to not increment (removed a call to printData(), since the Arduino likey ran out of SRAM when printData() was used)
